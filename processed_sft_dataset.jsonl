The segment connecting the midpoints of the parallel sides is sometimes called the \"height median\" or \"middle line\" when referring to its relation with the height and bases, but it is not the median of the trapezoid (which connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides).\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as $b_1 = BC = 1000$ and $b_2 = AD = 2008$.\nLet $h$ be the height of the trapezoid.\nDraw perpendiculars from $B$ and $C$ to the base $AD$.

We need to calculate the probability of two specific events happening in order when drawing cards from a standard deck without replacement.\n\n**Relevant Concepts:**\n*   **Standard Deck of Cards:** A standard deck has 52 cards, divided into 4 suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades), with 13 ranks in each suit (2, 3, ..., 10, J, Q, K, A).\n    *   There are 13 diamonds ($\\diamondsuit$).\n    *   There are 4 aces (one in each suit).\n    *   There is exactly one Ace of Diamonds ($\\diamondsuit A$).\n*   **Conditional Probability:** The probability of an event B occurring given that event A has already occurred, denoted as $P(B|A)$.\n*   **Multiplication Rule for Dependent Events:** The probability of two events A and B occurring in sequence is $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B|A)$.\n*   **Law of Total Probability:** If events $E_1, E_2, ..., E_n$ form a partition of the sample space (i.e., they are mutually exclusive and their union is the entire sample space), then for any event A, $P(A) = P(A|E_1)P(E_1) + P(A|E_2)P(E_2) + ... + P(A|E_n)P(E_n)$. We will use this by partitioning the event \"first card is a diamond\" into two sub-events.\n\n**Problem Setup:**\nLet $D$ be the event that the first card dealt is a diamond.\nLet $A$ be the event that the second card dealt is an ace.\n\nWe want to find the probability of both events occurring, $P(D \\cap A)$.\nUsing the multiplication rule, $P(D \\cap A) = P(D) \\times P(A|D)$.\n\nHowever, calculating $P(A|D)$ directly is complex because the probability of the second card being an ace depends on whether the first diamond drawn was the Ace of Diamonds or not. To handle this, we will use the Law of Total Probability by splitting the event $D$ into two mutually exclusive cases:\n\n1.  **Case 1:** The first card is the Ace of Diamonds ($\\diamondsuit A$).\n2.  **Case 2:** The first card is a diamond, but NOT the Ace of Diamonds.\n\nLet $D_{\\diamondsuit A}$ be the event that the first card is the Ace of Diamonds.\nLet $D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A}$ be the event that the first card is a diamond, but not the Ace of Diamonds.\n\nThe event $D$ is the union of $D_{\\diamondsuit A}$ and $D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A}$, and these are mutually exclusive. So, we can write:\n$P(D \\cap A) = P((D_{\\diamondsuit A} \\cup D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A}) \\cap A)$\n$P(D \\cap A) = P(D_{\\diamondsuit A} \\cap A) + P(D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A} \\cap A)$\n\nNow, we calculate the probability for each case:\n\n**Case 1: The first card is the Ace of Diamonds, AND the second card is an ace.**\n*   The probability of drawing the Ace of Diamonds as the first card is $P(D_{\\diamondsuit A}) = \\frac{1}{52}$ (since there is 1 Ace of Diamonds in 52 cards).\n*   After drawing the Ace of Diamonds, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck.\n*   The remaining aces are the Ace of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, and Ace of Spades. So, there are 3 aces left.\n*   The conditional probability of drawing an ace as the second card, given the first was the Ace of Diamonds, is $P(A | D_{\\diamondsuit A}) = \\frac{3}{51}$.\n*   The probability of this entire sequence (first card $\\diamondsuit A$, second card an ace) is:\n    $P(D_{\\diamondsuit A} \\cap A) = P(D_{\\diamondsuit A}) \\times P(A | D_{\\diamondsuit A}) = \\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51}$\n\n**Case 2: The first card is a diamond (but not $\\diamondsuit A$), AND the second card is an ace.**\n*   There are 13 diamonds in a deck, and 1 of them is the Ace of Diamonds. So, there are $13 - 1 = 12$ diamonds that are not aces.\n*   The probability of drawing a non-ace diamond as the first card is $P(D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A}) = \\frac{12}{52}$.\n*   After drawing a non-ace diamond, there are 51 cards remaining in the deck.\n*   All 4 aces are still in the deck (Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, Ace of Spades).\n*   The conditional probability of drawing an ace as the second card, given the first was a non-ace diamond, is $P(A | D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A}) = \\frac{4}{51}$.\n*   The probability of this entire sequence (first card a non-ace diamond, second card an ace) is:\n    $P(D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A} \\cap A) = P(D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A}) \\times P(A | D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A}) = \\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51}$\n\n**Combining the Cases:**\nNow, we add the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive cases to find the total probability that the first card is a diamond and the second is an ace:\n$P(D \\cap A) = P(D_{\\diamondsuit A} \\cap A) + P(D_{\\neg \\diamondsuit A} \\cap A)$\n$P(D \\cap A) = \\left(\\frac{1}{52} \\times \\frac{3}{51}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{12}{52} \\times \\frac{4}{51}\\right)$\n$P(D \\cap A) = \\frac{3}{52 \\times 51} + \\frac{48}{52 \\times 51}$\n$P(D \\cap A) = \\frac{3 + 48}{52 \\times 51}$\n$P(D \\cap A) = \\frac{51}{52 \\times 51}$\n\nWe can cancel out the 51 from the numerator and the denominator:\n$P(D \\cap A) = \\frac{1}{52}$\n\nThe probability that the first card is a diamond and the second card is an ace is $\\frac{1}{52}$.\n\n<answer>The probability that the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card is an ace is $\\frac{1}{52}$.</answer>"}], "original_metadata": {"level": "Level 4", "type": "Counting & Probability", "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a $\\diamondsuit$, it could be an ace or not be an ace.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the ace of $\\diamondsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the three remaining aces, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot \\dfrac{1}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{884}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}$ chance that a $\\diamondsuit$ other than the ace is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{4}{51}$ chance that an ace is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{13}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{884} + \\dfrac{4}{221} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.\n\nNotice that we can avoid some of the large denominators above by organizing this computation as follows: $$\\dfrac{1}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{3}{51}+\\dfrac{12}{52}\\cdot\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot 3+12\\cdot 4}{52\\cdot 51} = \\dfrac{51}{52\\cdot 51}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}.$$"}}

Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2005} - \\frac{1}{2007}$ is a positive value. This means $A > 2$.\n\n**Quantity C:**\n$C = \\frac{2007}{2006}+\\frac{2007}{2008}$\nSimilarly, I will rewrite these fractions:\n$\\frac{2007}{2006} = \\frac{2006+1}{2006} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2006}$\n$\\frac{2007}{2008} = \\frac{2008-1}{2008} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2008}$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for C:\n$C = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2006}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2008}\\right) = 2 + \\frac{1}{2006} - \\frac{1}{2008}$\nSince $2006 < 2008$, we know that $\\frac{1}{2006} > \\frac{1}{2008}$.

So, the speed is $\\frac{1}{3/2} = \\frac{2}{3}$ miles per minute.\n\n4.  **Calculate the distance traveled in 1 hour:** We need to find out how many miles the train travels in 1 hour.\n    *   First, convert 1 hour into minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes.\n    *   Now, use the formula Distance = Speed × Time.\n    *   Distance = $(\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ miles/minute}) \\times (60 \\text{ minutes})$\n    *   Distance = $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 60$ miles\n    *   Distance = $2 \\times \\frac{60}{3}$ miles\n    *   Distance = $2 \\times 20$ miles\n    *   Distance = 40 miles.\n\nAlternatively, we can convert the initial time to seconds and then calculate the speed in miles per second, finally converting to miles per hour.\n\n1.  **Convert time to seconds:**\n    *   1 minute 30 seconds = $(1 \\times 60) + 30$ seconds = $60 + 30 = 90$ seconds.\n\n2.  **Calculate speed in miles per second:**\n    *   Speed = $\\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{90 \\text{ seconds}}$\n\n3.  **Calculate distance in 1 hour:**\n    *   1 hour = 60 minutes = $60 \\times 60$ seconds = 3600 seconds.\n    *   Distance = Speed × Time\n    *   Distance = $(\\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{90 \\text{ seconds}}) \\times (3600 \\text{ seconds})$\n    *   Distance = $\\frac{3600}{90}$ miles\n    *   Distance = $\\frac{360}{9}$ miles\n    *   Distance = 40 miles.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The train travels 40 miles in 1 hour.\n</think> <answer>The problem asks us to find the total distance a freight train travels in 1 hour, given that it travels 1 mile in 1 minute 30 seconds.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the train's speed. The given time is 1 minute 30 seconds. To make calculations easier, we will convert this time into a single unit, minutes.\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so 30 seconds is equal to $\\frac{30}{60} = 0.5$ minutes.\nTherefore, 1 minute 30 seconds is $1 + 0.5 = 1.5$ minutes.\n\nThe train travels 1 mile in 1.5 minutes.\nThe speed of the train can be calculated using the formula:\n$Speed = \\frac{Distance}{Time}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$Speed = \\frac{1 \\text{ mile}}{1.5 \\text{ minutes}}$\n$Speed = \\frac{1}{1.5} \\text{ miles per minute}$\n\nTo simplify $\\frac{1}{1.5}$, we can write 1.5 as $\\frac{3}{2}$:\n$Speed = \\frac{1}{3/2} \\text{ miles per minute} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ miles per minute}$.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many miles the train will travel in 1 hour. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.\nWe use the formula:\n$Distance = Speed \\times Time$\n\nUsing the speed we calculated and the time of 1 hour (60 minutes):\n$Distance = \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\text{ miles per minute}\\right) \\times (60 \\text{ minutes})$\n$Distance = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 60 \\text{ miles}$\n$Distance = 2 \\times \\frac{60}{3} \\text{ miles}$\n$Distance = 2 \\times 20 \\text{ miles}$\n$Distance = 40 \\text{ miles}$\n\nThus, the train will travel 40 miles in 1 hour.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{40 \\text{ miles}}$.</answer>"}], "original_metadata": {"level": "Level 1", "type": "Algebra", "solution": "The train travels 1 mile in 1 minute 30 seconds.
