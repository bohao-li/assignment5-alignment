For integers a and b, this leads to four cases:\n- Case 1: a + b = 1 and a - b = 1 → a = 1, b = 0\n- Case 2: a + b = 1 and a - b = -1 → a = 0, b = 1\n- Case 3: a + b = -1 and a - b = 1 → a = 0, b = -1\n- Case 4: a + b = -1 and a - b = -1 → a = -1, b = 0\nThus, the ordered pairs are (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1), and (-1, 0). All satisfy the original equations, so there are 4 ordered pairs.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of integers that satisfy $|a + b| = 1$ and $|a - b| = 1$ is 4. The pairs are $(1, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, $(0, -1)$, and $(-1, 0)$.\n</answer>"}]}
